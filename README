This is a set of OpenGL bindings meant to be easy to use from Go.
They were made by generating bindings using (Christoph Schunk's
GoGL2 utility)[0] and modifying the output to be easier to use. For
example, glBufferData takes a slice or array and figures out the sizes
and types using reflection, object-oriented functions like glBindBuffer,
glShaderSource become methods on types such as buffer.Bind(),
shader.SetSource(), etc.
